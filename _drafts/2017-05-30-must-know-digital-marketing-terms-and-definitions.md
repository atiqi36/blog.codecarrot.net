Here you have it, your definitive list of must-know marketing terms. Whether you’re new to marketing or just need to brush up on some terminology, this post will share the most important marketing terms.

If you are new to the digital marketing industry you might find that the industry jargon some digital marketers use can be confusing, and at times you might not know what they are talking about. This is why we put this article together. There are hundreds of common digital marketing terms to know, but these are the ones that you should begin to understand.

You’ll find this article has been broken down into 4 digital marketing categories: general, inbound, social media, and email.

So let’s get started…

1.  **404 Page:**
    A web page displayed when you try to follow a dead or broken link. If you have a website, your hosting company will display its own default 404 page when this happens—or, if you use CodeCarrot Landing Pages, you can set up a custom 404 page that ensures you can still capture opt-ins.

2.  **A/B TEST:**
    A way of seeing which of two versions of a webpage (or ad, or email) performs better through exposing the different versions separate but equivalent groups of people. An A/B test is a form of **split test**.

3.  **AFFILIATE MARKETING:**
    A form of marketing in which independent marketers earn rewards through promoting a different company’s products, typically receiving a commission on purchases made through their **affiliate link**.

4.  **AFFILIATE LINK:**
    A URL for a merchant’s site that affiliate marketers provide to customers (often on their blog or website or in emails). When customers purchase something through this link, the merchant can then trace that purchase back to the affiliate marketer and pay them a commission accordingly.

5.  **ANALYTICS:**
    The numbers that tell you how your campaign is doing. Most of your **marketing automation** tools will have an analytics dashboard containing statistics that will help you measure success in various ways. For instance, each page you get has an analytics dashboard displaying the **page views**, **unique visitors**, and **opt-ins** the page has received across its history using **Google Analytics Tool**.

6.  **AUTORESPONDER SEQUENCE:**
    A timed sequence of emails triggered when someone opts into a certain email list. For instance, if someone becomes a new customer, you might set up an autoresponder sequence in your **email service provider** to send them one email about how to use a different part of your product every week.
    
7.  **BOUNCE RATE:**
    The percentage of visits to your page that end without any interaction with the page (such as clicking a button or navigating to a different page). The bounce rate on an effective **landing page** should be low.
    
8.  **BEHAVIORAL INERTIA:**
    The principle that people are likely to continue a sequence of actions once they’ve taken the first step. For instance, once someone has clicked on a button, they may as well click on the next one. A well-designed **funnel** relies on this principle by asking for a series of small commitments that eventually lead people to buy.
    
9.  **CALL TO ACTION (CTA):**
    The part of a **landing page** (or email, or other marketing asset) that asks people to do something, such as opting into an **email list** or making a purchase. A CTA is often a clickable button.
    
10.  **CAN-SPAM ACT:**
    The U.S. federal law designed to prevent companies from spamming people. In a nutshell, it requires that all commercial emails you send be non-deceptive, include your postal address, and contain a clear, functional method for recipients to opt out of future emails.
    
11.  **CART ABANDONMENT:**
    The phenomenon of online shoppers adding an item to their shopping cart but then deciding not to purchase. Studies have shown   that about 2/3 of e-commerce transactions initiated are never completed.

12.  **CASE STUDY:**
    A report on how a customer solved a particular problem using a company’s products or services. This can be an effective part of a **content marketing** campaign for business-to-business companies.

13.  **CHURN:**
    The rate at which you lose existing customers due to voluntary or involuntary reasons. Also known as customer attrition or customer turnover.

14.  **CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR):**
    The rate at which people click a link in one of your marketing assets to reach a given page on your site. For an email, this will be calculated by dividing the people who click a link in your email by the total number of people who receive the email. For an ad, it’ll be calculated by dividing the number of clicks on your ad by the total number of **impressions**.

15.  **CODE:**
    Shorthand for the various markup, style sheet, and programming languages that make web pages visible and functional on the internet. Some of the most common languages indicated when people talk about code are **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. (But if you use CodeCarrot Landing Pages, you don’t have to worry about it!)

16.  **CONTENT MARKETING:**
    Any marketing effort that uses consumable, informational content to attract the interest of potential customers. Common content-marketing assets include **white papers**, e-books, **infographics**, reports, and instructional videos.
    
17.  **CONTENT UPGRADE:**
    An asset you create as a **lead magnet** and offer in conjunction with a freely accessible piece of content such as a blog post. The content upgrade adds to or expands on the subject of the core content.

18.  **CONVERSION:**
    The point at which someone transitions from a **prospect** into a **lead** or a customer.

19.  **CONVERSION RATE:**
    Your success rate for a given piece of a campaign. Depending on your goals, this could mean the percentage of site visitors who opt into an **email list**, sign up for a **webinar**, make a purchase, or take some other desired action.

20.  **CONVERSION RATE OPTIMIZATION (CRO):**
    The process of improving your conversion rate by changing different pieces of your campaign. This could mean improving your keywords, redesigning your landing pages, or even changing something as small as the time of day you send emails. You can assess whether it’s working by **split testing** and examining your **analytics**.

21.  **COOKIE:**
    A piece of data that a website you visit stores in your browser. The next time you visit the website, your browser sends the cookie back to the site and lets it know you’ve been there before. This allows websites to do things like preserve your purchase history or remember your login name.

22.  **COPY:**
    Any persuasive language used in the service of your brand or product, typically enticing people to join your email list, make a purchase, or take another desired action.

23.  **COST PER ACQUISITION (CPA):**
    The average amount you spend in the course of an ad campaign to get a single **conversion**. Because not everyone who clicks on an ad will convert, your CPA for any given campaign will often be higher than your **cost per click (CPC)**.

24.  **COST PER CLICK (CPC):**
    The amount you agree to pay when running a **pay-per-click** **(PPC) advertising** campaign every time someone clicks on your ad.

25.  **COST PER IMPRESSION (CPI)/COST PER THOUSAND IMPRESSIONS (CPM):**
    The amount you spend per each time a visitor sees one of your ads.

26.  **CSS:**
    Short for Cascading Style Sheets. This is a language that tells web browsers how the content of your web page (typically written in **HTML**) should be displayed.

27.  **DIRECT MARKETING:**
    Any form of marketing addressed specifically to a known group of **prospects** to convince them to take a desired action, often relying on a database of customer contacts. Direct marketing can be as old-fashioned as a flyer in the mail or as modern as a targeted advertisement on Facebook.

28.  **EMAIL LIST:**
    A collection of email addresses belonging to your leads, which you can use to send them information. It’s best to store this with your **email service provider**.
    
29.  **EVERGREEN:**
    A marketing asset that works for you around the clock, forever. For instance, a **lead magnet** that is relevant to your general customer demographic and isn’t time-sensitive could serve as an **evergreen** resource on your website.

30.  **EMAIL SERVICE PROVIDER (ESP):**
    The service you use to store email contacts and send emails to all or some of your **leads**. A few popular ESPs include MailChimp, AWeber, and Infusionsoft.

31.  **FORM FIELD:**
    A box that asks for someone’s information, such as a name or an email address. (Tests often show that **conversion rates** improve when you require fewer form fields.)

32.  **FACEBOOK ADS:**
    Facebook’s popular social-media advertising system, notable for letting you choose a target audience with extreme precision.

33.  **FUNNEL:**
    Any process designed to turn **prospects** into **leads** and, ultimately, customers. One simple example of a funnel would be an online ad that takes prospects to a **landing page**, where they opt into your **email list**, receive an email  directing them to a product page, and ultimately make a purchase.

34.  **“GIVING PAGE:”**
    A page whose evident purpose is to give something to visitors, such as a **lead magnet**. Contrast with **taking page**.

35.  **GOOGLE ADWORDS:**
    The most popular **pay per click (PPC)** advertising system in the world. Its Keyword Planner is a very useful tool for researching which keywords will work best for your ads.

36.  **HTML:**
    Short for hypertext markup language, the standard language used to tell web browsers how to interpret the information on your webpage.

37.  **IMPRESSION:**
    What happens each time an online ad is fetched from its source and displayed. Some advertising systems charge per impression.

38.  **INFOGRAPHIC:**
    A document that represents information visually, often with the help of graphs, charts, and illustrations. Infographics often make for popular **lead magnets**.

39.  **INTEGRATION HANDOFF:**
    The point at which you have collected a prospect’s email address and you deliver it to your **email service provider**. (With CodeCarrot Landing Pages, you can set this up to occur automatically as soon as someone submits and opt-in form.)

40.  **JAVASCRIPT:**
A dynamic programming language that allows visitors to interact with websites via forms, widgets, and other elements.

41.  **LANDING PAGE:**
    A web page designed to get visitors to take a specific action, such as subscribing to an **email list**, downloading a **lead magnet**, or making a purchase.

42.  **KEYWORDS:**
    Words in your web content that tell search engines or advertising systems what that content is about. Within systems like **Google AdWords**, you choose relevant keywords to bid on so that when visitors search for those keywords, your ad will be displayed on the search results page if your bid is high enough. If you’re optimizing a page for **SEO**, you’ll want to include a target keyword throughout the page.

43.  **LANDING PAGE TEMPLATE:**
    A pre-made landing page (including layout, images, buttons, and sample text) that you can customize for your business. If you’re a CodeCarrot Landing Pages member, you just need to click and type to do this. If you know how to **code**, you can also get templates as a collection of files that you can customize and host on the server you use.

44.  **LEAD:**
    A person who has expressed some degree of interest in your products or services, often by opting into an **email list**.

45.  **LEADDIGITS:**
    CodeCarrot Landing Pages’ mobile lead-generation tool. Potential customers text a chosen word to a specific phone number in order to get relevant information or download a **lead magnet**. They’re then prompted to text back their email address in order to fulfill the request. (And 98% of them do!)

46.  **LEADBOX:**
    A pop-up opt-in form triggered by a button on a **CodeCarrot Landing Pages**, most often used to collect email addresses from page visitors.
    
47.  **LEADLINKS:**
    CodeCarrot Landing Pages’ one-step signup tool. When you paste one of these special URLs into an email, subscribers can simply click the link in order to instantly subscribe to an **email list** or sign up for a webinar.
    
48.  LEADPAGE:
    A landing page created with a LeadPages® template.

The LeadPages® feature that lets you automatically send a
lead magnet when someone opts in.

52.  LEAD MAGNET:
Something you give away for free in exchange for someone’s
email address. Also known as an opt-in bribe.

53.  LONG-TAIL KEYWORDS:
Search keywords that identify a very specific search goal (think
“home brewing craft pilsner kit” instead of “craft beer kit”).
Though keywords like this have a relatively low search volume
(hence their position in the “long tail” when you chart
keywords by number of searches), they can help you target
prospects who have done some initial research and may be
ready to buy.

54.  LEAD NOTIFICATIONS:
The LeadPages® feature that sends you emails with details on
each new opt-in you collect.

55.  LOOKALIKE AUDIENCES:
A Facebook Ads feature that lets you target people who share
behaviors and characteristics with people who are similar to
your current customers (and thus more likely to be interested).

A website that requires membership to see some or all of its
resources. Once a user pays or signs up for membership
access, they’re given immediate access to pages and features
that are invisible to non-members.

57.  METADATA:
Data used to interpret your content, whether by search
engines or by people. Examples include the descriptions that
show up under each URL on search-results pages and the
HTML tags that tell web browsers which part of your page is
the headline and which is the body.

58.  NATIVE ADVERTISING:
Advertising that takes similar form to other content on the
platform where it appears. Native ads can show up in social
media feeds, on search-results pages, and on blogs, among
other places.

59.  ONE-PAGE DESIGN:
A currently popular and often high-converting web-design
model in which most information on a website is kept on one
page and accessed in a specific order via vertical scrolling.
Pages like this also tend to be very mobile-friendly.

60.  OPEN RATE:
The percentage of emails opened out of the total number of
emails sent. You can find out your open rate by checking your

61.  OPT-IN:
An online signup, often taking the form of a site visitor
entering an email address and joining your email list.

62.  ORGANIC TRAFFIC:
Visits to your website that happen “naturally,” through
avenues such as finding your site on a search-results page or
clicking a link in a blog post that mentions your site.

63.  PAGE VIEW:
A single instance of someone viewing a page on your website,
counted when a page request is sent from a browser to your
server.

64.  PAID TRAFFIC:

A form of advertising in which the price you pay is determined
by the number of clicks your ad receives.

accounts or from their history of using other LeadPages®
forms.

A form of native advertising in which you pay to give a post
from one of your social-media feeds more exposure than it
would normally receive.

70.  PROSPECT:
Someone who is potentially interested in your products or
services, but who has not yet identified themselves as a lead.

71.  QUALITY SCORE:
One factor that helps determine your cost per click when you
use Google AdWords. (A higher quality score makes for a lower
cost.) Google calculates a quality score based on your
click-through rate, the relevance of your keywords and ad text,
the quality and relevance of your landing page, and your past
AdWords history.

72.  RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
A model of web design in which elements on your page resize
and rearrange themselves automatically when viewed on
screens of different sizes, such as mobile devices. (All
LeadPages® templates are fully mobile-responsive.)

73.  RETARGETING AD:
An ad that appears on multiple sites or site visits for a single
user who’s been targeted via a tracking pixel, encouraging
them to return to a site they’ve visited before.

74.  RETENTION:
The rate at which your customers remain your customers.

75.  ROI:
Short for return on investment. The marketing results you’ve
achieved as compared to the amount you spent to achieve
them.

76.  SAAS:
Short for software as a service, indicating a web-based
software product you access via subscription.

77.  SALES FUNNEL:
A series of steps designed to convince people to make a
purchase. Does not necessarily include collecting leads.

78.  SEARCH COMPETITION:
An assessment of how many other pages are also using a given
search keyword. If your competition for a given keyword is
lower, you have a better chance of showing up on a
search-results page and will likely pay less if you’re running
pay per click ads.

79.  SEARCH VOLUME:
The number of searches performed for a given keyword,
usually analyzed per month.

80.  SEGMENTATION:
The process of identifying different groups within your
audience, leads, or customers. Once you’ve done this, you can
target different segments with different kinds of campaigns.

81.  SEO:

changes to a web page’s content, structure, and metadata to
make it show up more prominently on search-results pages.

82.  SERP:
Short for search engine results page, the list of results you get
when you perform an internet search. A SERP may also display
pay per click and native ads in addition to organic results.

programs to “serve” it to visitors when it gets a request from a
web browser.

84.  SLUG:
The end of a URL that can be customized for your each page on
your website.

85.  SMS:
Short for short message service, this is the set of protocols and
technology that allows you to send text messages via phone.

86.  SPLIT TEST:
A way of seeing which of two or more versions of a webpage
(or ad, or email) performs better through exposing the
different versions separate but equivalent groups of people. A
two-version split test can also be known as an A/B test.

87.  SUBDOMAIN:
A part of a larger web domain. When you sign up for a
LeadPages® account, you get your own subdomain—it’s the
part of the URL that appears directly before “leadpages.net”
on any page you publish to our servers.

88. “TAKING PAGE:”
A page whose evident purpose is to take something from
visitors, such as a landing page with a one-step opt-in form
placed directly on the page. Contrast with the typically more
effective giving page (which you can create easily by
substituting a LeadBox™ for your one-step opt-in form).

89.  TARGETING:
Selecting certain groups of people to see your ads, defined by
their shared characteristics.

90.  TRACKING PIXEL:
A tiny, invisible image placed on your landing page or ad that
can keep track of who’s viewing it. When the page loads, a
visitor’s browser will make a request to a third-party server to
load the “image,” which the server can register and, ultimately,
relay to your analytics dashboard.

91.  UNIQUES:
Shorthand for unique visitors or unique opt-ins. Because one
person can view a landing page or opt in for a lead magnet
multiple times, it’s useful to know how many of those page
views or opt-ins are from new potential customers.

92.  WEBINAR:
A class or seminar streamed (usually live) over the web.
Webinars can be an effective part of your content marketing
strategy.

93.  WHITE PAPER:
A report issued by a company in order to promote the
company’s products or services. This is most frequently used
in business-to-business marketing.
