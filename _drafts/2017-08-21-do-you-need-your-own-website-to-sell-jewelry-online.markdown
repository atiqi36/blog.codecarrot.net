If you sell jewelry online, chances are you use one of the many eCommerce platforms for makers, such as Flipkart or Amazon. So is it even worth spending the time and effort to create your own eCommerce website when you have so many big-name platforms to choose from? In a word, yes. Maintaining your own site is a fantastic way to sell jewelry online.

## Sell jewelry online (without the middleman) in 3 steps

1. Name your shop.
2. Create your eCommerce store.
3. Fill your jewelry cases.

Before we walk through the process of building your own online store, let’s talk a little bit about what makes this an attractive option for serious artisans and jewelers.

## Why do I need my own store?

While I’m not saying shut down your Etsy shop, it’s worth investing time and money in your own website, especially if you’re serious about taking your jewelry-making career to the next level.

**Instant credibility**

Having your own website makes your business look legit. On your own site, you have the ability to fully customize your own branding and layout in a way that you can’t on sites like Etsy. You can direct the flow of traffic, encourage people to [sign up for your newsletter](/market/beginners-guide-to-starting-an-email-list/) (hello, handy pop-ups!) and show them similar products they might like.

**All the profits**

Anytime you sell jewelry online on someone else’s site, you’re giving up a portion of the profits in the form commission. Sell that same bracelet or necklace from your own website, and the profits are all yours.

**Your own identity**

Having your own website also makes your brand more memorable. How many times have you heard someone say, “I got this on Etsy!” instead of, “I got it from this cute online shop called Two Little Peonies?” Yep, raising my hand here on this one.

<blockquote>When you sell jewelry online via your own website, people look at your jewelry as its own entity instead of just another piece in a sea of products.</blockquote>

While you might be immersed in the world of Etsy and know it better than your best friend, your average customer might not realize they’re buying something from you, an individual jewelry designer, instead of from Etsy itself.

**A (more) captive audience**

In fact, on Etsy a potential customer could inadvertently click a link that takes them out of your shop. It’s much easier to keep visitors on your own site when they’re not distracted by all the pretty shiny objects floating around those big eCommerce platforms.

**Control over your destiny**

When a site makes a major change to their platform — and that’s been known to happen — it can impact the flow of traffic to your individual shop and ultimately the number of sales you make. On your own website, you decide what changes to make. If you don’t like them or they have a negative impact on sales, just change it back!
