Is your writing goal to get published by one of your favorite websites?

**CodeCarrot is looking for contributors.**

CodeCarrot seeks practical, actionable advice on business, growth, project management, design, dev, and tips that will help people in their own journey.

Contributors looking to send readers to their website, portfolio or book can opt for a link in their bio of payment.

## Ready to get started? Consult this checklist:

* To get a sense for the type of work we publish, read our site! That’s the best way to familiarize yourself with our voice and style.
* Then, [check out our contributor guidelines](https://codecarrot.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000388872-Contributor-Guidelines). We love writers who pay close attention to detail and submit their posts in our preferred manner.
* Share your Dropbox Paper with **contact@codecarrot.net**. Make sure we can edit it.
* Allow one-two weeks for a response to your pitch or submission before following up (We get a lot of ‘em!).
