Markdown is a simple text-based markup language and conversion tool that allows writers to create great content for the web without having to worry too much about HTML. The syntax of the language is designed to be easy to learn and intuitive. It’s ideal for people that write content for the web but that might be distracted by the HTML syntax.

**Note:** Markdown wasn’t really designed as a language for creating complete web pages. It’s more suitable for just content areas like the body of a blog post, an article or web page copy.

Markdown files use the `.md` or `.text` extensions
