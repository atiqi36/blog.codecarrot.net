In a few short years, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) has evolved as the development tool of choice for serious and casual programmers alike, alongside Code and Atom. It is freemium, lightweight, cross-platform compatible and endless customization options.

One reason for Sublime Text's popularity is its large library of plugins. Installation is as easy as placing the plugin in the packages directory.

You can set up your own shortcut keys for each of these commands.

## 4. [GitHubinator](https://github.com/ehamiter/ST2-GitHubinator)

## 5. [Focus File on Sidebar](https://github.com/miguelgraz/FocusFileOnSidebar)

Sublime Text has two options regarding its sidebar: `Toggle Side Bar` and `Reveal in Side Bar`, people want to browse their files tree right on the opened file's folder, which isn't possible with those two options alone. Focus File on Sidebar gives you another option to `Focus`. It allows to open sidebar and move focus right to the opened file's place on project's tree.

## 6. [CTags](https://github.com/SublimeText/CTags)

## 7. [CoffeeScriptHaml](https://github.com/jisaacks/CoffeeScriptHaml)

Sublime Text doesn't have a good support with with [.hamlc files](https://github.com/netzpirat/haml-coffee). Installing CoffeeScriptHaml will do all the syntax highlighting all the `.hamlc` files.
