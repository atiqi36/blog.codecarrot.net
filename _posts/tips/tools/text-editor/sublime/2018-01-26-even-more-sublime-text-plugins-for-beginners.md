[Sublime Text](//www.sublimetext.com/) features such as GoTo Anything, Multiple Selections, Command Palette, Split Editing and Instant Patch Switching are just a few reasons why this editor is so popular with developers. The extensibility of the program is further enhanced by the wide array of Sublime plugins. Plugins facilitate the usage of the editor and fill in spaces not covered by the included features.

Part 1 introduced you to [twelve very useful Sublime Text plugins](/12-sublime-text-plugins-not-only-for-newbies). Here are 8 more to add to your web development toolbox and help you enhance your Sublime themes.

## [**SCSS**](//packagecontrol.io/packages/SCSS)

SCSS takes CSS syntax to the next level. It is an expanded version that includes all the CSS features plus Sass features. Semi-colons and brackets are still used, but you don't have to worry about indentation or white spaces. It was developed by front-end engineer, [Mario Ricalde](//twitter.com/mario_ricalde).

## [**Search Stack Overflow**](//github.com/ericmartel/Sublime-Text-2-Stackoverflow-Plugin)

If you find yourself doing a lot of tedious searches on StackOverflow, then you will love this simple Sublime plugin created by [Eric Martel](//twitter.com/emartelAI). You can do quick searches to find exactly what you are looking for, in a fraction of the time.

## [**SublimeLinter-ruby**](//github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-ruby)

The SublimeLinter is a plugin that provides web developers with an interface to linting through ruby-wc. It is for use with files with Ruby syntax and needs SubLimeLinter 3 to work.

## [**Sublime RuboCop**](//github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop)

Using rules based on the Ruby Style Guide created by the open community, RuboCop checks the code style, and when run with no arguments, checks all Ruby source files in the directory currently open. You can also check specific files and directories. RuboCop was created by [Patrick Derichs](//twitter.com/pjderichs).

## [**RSpec**](//github.com/SublimeText/RSpec)

RSpec is a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) testing framework designed for Ruby that makes Test Driven Development (TDD) much more fun and productive. This package supports Sublime Text 2 and 3 to test and specify Ruby apps and contains plenty of snippets and syntax highlighting.

## [**JsFormat**](//github.com/jdc0589/JsFormat)

The JsFormat Sublime plugin is just what sounds like â€“ a JavaScript formatting tool for Sublime Text 2. All settings can be customized to suit your needs. Developed by [Davis Clark](//twitter.com/jdc0589), the plugin allows you to easily format all or parts of js and json files.

## [**Nettuts+ Fetch**](//github.com/weslly/Nettuts-Fetch)

This Sublime plugin allows you to automatically pull up the latest version of a file by entering a keyword, perform a curl request on a specified URL, and gives you the peace of mind that you are always using the most recent version of an asset. You can thank the brilliant mind of [Weslly](//github.com/weslly) for this plugin.

## [**Sass textmate bundle**](//github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle)

Sass syntax was closely related to Haml, and even shared the same Ruby Gem, but the languages split apart. 

The indented syntax of Sass makes it seem like a foreign language compared to CSS, leading some web developers to believe it to be just a passing fad. This add-on adds syntax highlighting and tab/code completion for Sass and SCSS files. It also features Zen Coding shortcuts for many CSS properties!

These Sublime Text plugins are easy to install and easy to use. Which one is your favorite?
