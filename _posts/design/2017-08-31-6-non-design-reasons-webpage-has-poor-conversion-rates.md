Conversion rates are one of the most popular and accurate KPIs in web apps. That’s why you want to keep them high. There are many reasons why conversion rates are low, and we usually associate them with design issues. That said, the reasons for poor conversion rates can go way beyond interfaces, colors and the content used. Solving the non-design issues mentioned in this article will [help you boost conversion rates and will also take less time, money and effort than redesign and implementation](6-reasons-why-your-frontend-maintenance-costs-so-much).

## Your Web Page is Slow

According to [Aberden Group Report](http://www.aberdeen.com/research/5136/ra-performance-web-application/content.aspx), a 1-second delay in page load time equals 11 percent fewer page views, a 16-percent decrease in customer satisfaction, and a 7-percent loss in conversions. The website speed can substantially decrease the number of current and potential clients. Internet users are by no means a patient folk. If the website fails to load within expected time, they won’t hesitate and head to your competition. These stats are ruthless but show that you can’t afford to keep your website slow.

## You Don’t React to Users Behaviour

There is only a short time window in which you can react to a user’s behaviour. For example, if he or she clicks the button, is there any immediate reaction? What if he or she opens a menu or starts typing in autocomplete input? Every user is expecting a reaction, and if the website doesn’t react, they think it’s broken and leave.

## You Don’t Handle Errors Gracefully

One of the most common reasons for leaving an app is when a user experiences and error and there’s no information on what went wrong. Users would rather see that something went wrong and that you guys are working on it, rather than seeing no results and feeling abandoned. In the former scenario, chances are they will come back once it’s fixed. In the latter, you might just expect them to spread a negative opinion about your website among their peers.

## You Fetch Too Much Data on Your Pages

This piece advice is perfect for Single Page Applications, but might be applied to others too. When you work on a feature or a page, ask yourself what data are crucial for the user and specify less important things that can be fetched later in the background. For example, when you build a blog post page, it is the blog post’s content that is crucial here. Consequently, we can easily skip comments and load them after the initial page renders. It won’t spoil the experience and will increase the website’s loading speed.

## You Don’t Support Your Users’ Browsers

Have you checked how your website works on browsers your visitors use? All the relevant data can be found in analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, and you should monitor these data on a regular basis. Perhaps your most valuable users mostly use Internet Explorer 9 on their corporate machines, and you don’t even know about that? You might be missing on many opportunities if your website doesn’t display properly on a browser that the majority of your audience like.

## Your Web App is Useless on Mobile

Have you ever used your web app on mobile? Have you used it on a device other than your own, which probably is the latest iPhone or a flagship Android device? You should check your web app's performance on older devices with different operating systems to make sure it is also usable on those. Very often, the UX can be totally broken due to bad implementations – for instance, the menu bar or other crucial features might not be clickable at all.

## Summary

A perfect design is not the only way you can increase conversion rates. There are a lot of things to consider, among them page load speed issues. You should make the overall performance and compatibility a priority when working on your products – make sure you have top experts working on it.
